/**
 * VP4 config for `createModernFractalDescriptor`.
 *
 * The VP4 (model byte 0x14) is a gen-3 effects pedal: it reuses the gen-3
 * SysEx envelope + the III's effects codec and block effect IDs, but it is
 * AM4-SHAPE on the front panel — a serial 4-slot chain with 4 scenes,
 * A-D channels, and A01..Z04 preset locations (NOT the gen-3 6x14 grid /
 * 8 scenes). It has no amp/cab section.
 *
 * VERIFICATION / GATING. The gen-3 envelope/checksum/effect-ID layer and the
 * VP4 fn=0x01 frame are confirmed byte-exact from community captures (fw 4.03).
 * The VP4 SET frame is its OWN shape (no sub-action, a `tc` sub-opcode, a
 * swapped-septet float — see `fractal-midi/gen3/vp4/setParam.ts`). This config ships
 * READS plus two byte-exact, community-beta (untested-on-hardware) writes:
 * `set_bypass` and `save_preset` (see `write_allowlist`). Every OTHER write
 * stays GATED (`writes_gated: true`): `set_param` (per-param value calibration +
 * discrete/continuous distinction undecoded), `set_block` (placement value→slot
 * math undecoded), `switch_scene` (value↔scene mapping unconfirmed), plus
 * apply_preset / rename / switch_preset refuse with a clear message. community-beta.
 *
 * CATALOG. paramIds are VP4-true (mined from VP4-Edit's own binary; reusing
 * the III's mis-addresses 99.1% of shared params — see
 * `docs/_private/MINING-FINDINGS-FM-VP4.md`). The mined catalog is shared
 * across the gen-3 editor family, so it carries DISTORT (amp) + CABINET
 * params even though the physical VP4 has no amp/cab; `exclude_blocks`
 * drops those two blocks from the surface (device_true_roster alone won't —
 * it only drops EMPTY mapped families, and these are non-empty in the mine).
